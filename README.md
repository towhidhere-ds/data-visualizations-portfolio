## Project: GDP and Life Expectancy Analysis

### Overview
This project investigates the relationship between GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and life expectancy across six nations. By analyzing and visualizing the data, the project aims to answer key socio-economic questions.

## Blog Post: Unlocking the Link Between GDP and Life Expectancy

As part of this project, I wrote a blog post to explain my findings in more detail, including the story behind the data, the methodology, and the insights uncovered.
